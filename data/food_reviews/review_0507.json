A big difference.<br /><br />I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.<br /><br />I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn't sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.<br /><br />I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it's in a glass. I'm not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I'm a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.<br /><br />A lot of people are mentioning it's over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it's not Amazon selling it, it's a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.<br /><br />But I'm happy it's at my local health food store. I'm not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks, Taste Nirvana. This really is \"Happiness in a bottle.\" Go get your own. I'm not sharing ;)"}
