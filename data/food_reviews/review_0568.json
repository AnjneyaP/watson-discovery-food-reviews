I started drinking Oolong tea about two years ago and really enjoyed it - this one is no exception. You could add honey to it but it tastes very flavourful and sweet without. There's no bitterness to it like there is with some herbal teas without honey. It's a really nice lunchtime/afternoon relaxing tea to have!"}
