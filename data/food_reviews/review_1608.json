It was a little salty for my taste, but not too bad.  Some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness, but that would also reduce the amount of heat.  The bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch.  Given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value, I would eat this occasionally, not often, to satisfy a craving."}
