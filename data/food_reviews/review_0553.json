The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.<br /><br />The price is right."}
