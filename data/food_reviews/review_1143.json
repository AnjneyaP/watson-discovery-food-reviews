Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.<br /><br />I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the \"run around\" game, so BEWARE."}
