In fact, it might just be one of my favorite foods around.  It's tried and true, rarely cooks wrong, and always good to warm the belly and soul.  I only but this flavor, it's so good, why deviate from it?  I have tried other brands before, bit Maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time."}
