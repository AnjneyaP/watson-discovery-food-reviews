As someone with a sensitive stomach, it has always been a challenge for me to find protein drinks that don't irritate my stomach and also taste great and have a good nutritional profile.  Mix 1 is the only brand I've found that meets all of these requirements.<br /><br />I ordered the Vanilla shake as soon as I saw that it was available on Amazon.  I really enjoy it!<br /><br />It has a very natural vanilla flavour and does not taste artificial like most vanilla-flavoured protein drinks.  It tastes like a delicious vanilla milkshake but without the heaviness of a real milkshake.  The consistency of this shake is a little bit thinner than the regular Mix 1 protein drinks that I am used to, but it is definitely not watery.  I really like it for breakfast, because in the morning I don't usually feel like downing a whole one of the regular Mix 1 protein drinks with the slightly thicker consistency...I prefer those in the afternoon."}
