This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now."}
