The first time I tried it I became hooked but once you are 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through the 12pk I felt like I may have had enough of it and wanted just plain coconut water. I definitely like the chocolate flavor but it is more of \"I need to be in the mood\" type of thing rather than being able to drink it daily like I can with plain."}
