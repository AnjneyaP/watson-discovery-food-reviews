It's great, I love it.  Read my review on it here within this site.  For those of you who don't know - the Keurig \"K-cup\" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!!"}
