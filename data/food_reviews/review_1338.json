I purchase the capsules version, even though my dog takes two tablets a day, because you get larger pockets with the capsule version.  I cut each pocket in thirds use each piece to cover the small pills I give my dog. There is no waste and the package lasts three times longer.  My dog loves takes her meds with no problem."}
