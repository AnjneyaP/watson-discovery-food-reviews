The package has all the appeal of an average healthy snack bar. It also touts Non GMO ingredients, and they donate 5% of their profits to PeaceWorks Foundation. Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as \"The Flavor\" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good."}
