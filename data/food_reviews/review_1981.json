The others . . . not so much. But it does make a nice addition to my ever-growing wet bar. they are sweet, so go easy with them.  I find all it takes is about 1-1.5 cap fulls to flavor the drink. anything more than that and you get that artificial sweetener taste.  Also, for those that care, the irish cream, chocolate, hazelnut and raspberry are gluten free."}
