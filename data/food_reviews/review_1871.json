He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer."}
