By far, I like the cheddar potato the best. Second in line is the sour cream, and third is the BBQ. I recently bought 12 bags of Cheddar on Amazon!<br />These are much better than those baked chips out on the market (in my opinion). Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes-people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).<br />The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).<br />Yummy!"}
