They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it."}
