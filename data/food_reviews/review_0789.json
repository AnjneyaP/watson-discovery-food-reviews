The cookies are essentially flavored shortbread with a very distinct taste of butter, honey, and almonds and an excellent texture at once crumbly and crispy with a nice buttery mouthfeel.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to run across them at Jack's $0.99 Store (2 packages for $0.99!) in three flavors:  Honey & Almond, Ginger & Lemon, and Rosehip & Blackcurrant.  They were quite the hit and immediately became the subject of conversation.<br /><br />The Honey & Almond was universally loved.  A few people thought that the ginger was a bit too strong or else didn't like the floral taste of the rosehips but those were just personal preferences of people generally not fond of those flavors.  In each instance, I thought the flavor combinations  were both well chosen and perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Overall, you couldn't ask for better quality in a packaged cookie.  I only regret that the Chocolate & Raspberry, Coconut & Lime, and Vanilla & Cream varieties weren't available to try as well.  Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Wheat flour<br />Butter 25.7%<br />Sugar<br />Honey 6.2%<br />Nibbed almonds 1.1%<br />Natural almond flavoring<br />Emulsifier (Soya lecithin)<br />Raising agent (Sodium bicarbonate)<br /><br />Each 150g/5.3 oz package contains 18 cookies or 6 servings of 3 cookies<br /><br />Nutrition per serving of 3 cookies:<br /><br />Calories 130<br />Calories from fat 50<br />Total fat 6g<br />Saturated fat 4g<br />Trans fat 0.2g<br />Cholesterol 15mg<br />Sodium 45mg<br />Total carbohydrates 18g<br />Dietary fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars 6g<br />Protein 1g"}
