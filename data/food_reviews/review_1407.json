They have a ridge across the top so you can snap the biscuit in two. I cannot always get them to break, but I'm an older woman.<br />Both the Rottweiler and the Cocker Spaniel like them.  The cocker has the same problem I do, the hard texture.  But this is no problem for the larger dog.<br />My experience with the Newman's Own brands has always been positive.  And this really is a product from New Zealand.<br />Here's the ingredients list:<br />organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, palm oil, organic molasses.<br /><br />I would consider buying them, but only for larger dogs or ones with strong jaws."}
