They are delicious, healthy, and they're the perfect little snack to keep in my bag for after the gym. BUT BE AWARE, many of the flavors (like the chocolate, cinnamon roll, and cherry pie) are all over powered by the flavor of dates. They're not bad, but there is nothing else you can taste in those flavors besides dates and nuts. I would buy one to try before investing in a whole box of the flavor you're looking for."}
