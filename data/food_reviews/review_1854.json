My son is 6 months old and is a bit particular.  He spits out most veggies, except sweet potatoes of course, and even a lot of fruits, unless I mix them with cereal to thicken them up a bit!  He loves the thick texture of this food!!!  So from a frustrated mommy, this is a great thing!!!  If your child is refusing green beans or sweet peas, give this a try!  Its got enough texture to please my babe, it may be your favorite too!!"}
