I think these bars fit the bill. They are a little dry and some people may not find them sweet enough, but I am totally fine with that because I'm more concerned about added sugars and over-processed grains in other granola bars. I was happy with my purchase and I was surprised how compact the packaging was too! It made storing these bars easier in my tiny kitchen."}
