Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from \"the best hot chocolate ever\" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with."}
