Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the \"Americano\" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy \"Americano\" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me."}
