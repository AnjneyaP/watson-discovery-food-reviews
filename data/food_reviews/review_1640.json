The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU\">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee."}
