I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!"}
