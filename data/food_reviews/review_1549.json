I bought the Cherry Pie bar at my local grocery store and it was GREAT.  From the look of it and my experience with natural snack bars in the past, I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was VERY sweet and tasty, despite having no added sugar and all of THREE natural ingredients.  Sure, it's 200 calories, but it's filling and satisfied my (huge) sweet tooth.  I can't wait to try other flavors!"}
