The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.<br />Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.<br />I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.<br />Customer service answered quickly and said \"They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals\" completely free.<br />How wonderful of them!!!<br />You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful \"customer service!\" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make \"Sole\" and cook with it every day!!!"}
