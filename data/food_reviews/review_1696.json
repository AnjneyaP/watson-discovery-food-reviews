Seems just like \"soft\" water","Text":"This is nice bottled water. It does have minerals added - and the taste is slightly different. It reminds me of \"soft\" water. So if you like that type of taste or prefer it, then this is for you. If you like a crisper (the only way I know hoe to describe it) or \"harder\" water, then you wont like it.<br /><br />The other good news, is that the bottle it self is strong, like the old water bottles used to be. Not like the thin flimsy stuff you get today. So if you like to reuse your water bottles (like me) this one is great!"}
