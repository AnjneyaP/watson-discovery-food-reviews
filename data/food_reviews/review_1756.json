It has become part of my bedtime ritual now.  It adds just that little 'extra' that my system needs to sleep more soundly.  I have to tell you that taking two 'Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc pills are crucial for me.  The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system, and don't drink coffee at 11 a.m., but since I found Bedtime Tea, I don't go anywhere without it.  I order 6-12 boxes at a time.  Good Stuff."}
