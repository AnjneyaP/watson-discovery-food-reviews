When we discovered this pepper gravy, we decided that there was no need for the time and mess to make homemade as this was as close as you can get to homemade and again without all the time and mess.  As indicated by others, the addition of other ingredients such as sausage is also quite simple.  We would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys peppered gravy."}
