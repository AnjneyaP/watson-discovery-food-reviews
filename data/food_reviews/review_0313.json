We make about two loaves a week, in different varieties of the Hodgson Mill brand.  The honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great.<br />I like using my old bread machine to make the dough, then shape into loaf and bake in the oven.  Makes perfect loaf every time, also makes delicious rolls.<br />Glad I discovered this brand of bread mixes on Amazon--they are wholesome, and I know what I'm putting into the bread I bake now.  Great product!"}
