I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there."}
