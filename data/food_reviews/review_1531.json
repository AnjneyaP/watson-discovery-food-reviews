However, people like me who don't have these restrictions enjoy them just for the great taste! As a big fan of oatmeal, coconut, and chocolate, I know that many products containing these ingredients are not good for me. That's why I'm thrilled that I discovered Pamela's products. I can enjoy what I love without a guilty conscience! Instead of picking up a candy bar, I have a Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bar instead. Delicious!"}
