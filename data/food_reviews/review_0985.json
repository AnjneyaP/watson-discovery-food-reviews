After posting a less than glowing review, I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new \"fresher\" bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested, it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco bread to go with it.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt, courteous service."}
