Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for \"food emergencies\".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores."}
