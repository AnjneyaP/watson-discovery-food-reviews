I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff!"}
