One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe!  One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean!  This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good.  As another reviewer mentioned, they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent!  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with.  I don't know how long they will remain fresh because I haven't had that issue, but as quickly as I use them, I don't expect to.  This is a tremendous value!!"}
