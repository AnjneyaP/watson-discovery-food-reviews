I never really liked wasting all the plastic so I was happy to give these a try.  The coffee is very comparable in strength and tastes great!  But most of all, the design of these k-cups eliminates a large portion of the plastic and work great!  You do need to store them in an air-tight container, but they came packaged in separate 12-pack sealed bags which will keep the coffee fresh until I'm ready to use it.  I'm willing to change my storage container in order to help the environment just a little.  So willing that I just cancelled my Coffee People Subscribe & Save order and replaced with SFBay's Fog Chaser!"}
