I've always called that \"a good strong cup of coffee\".<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold."}
