I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, \"nowhere close to my custom grind and French press.\" But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other \"bold\" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)"}
