It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!"}
