The product is 100% juice, though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or \"berry\":<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me.  The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor."}
