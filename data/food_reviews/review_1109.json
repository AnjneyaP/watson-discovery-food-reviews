The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips."}
