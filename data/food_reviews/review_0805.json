My cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats I have gotten for him without him throwing up. I stopped using grocery store treats and moved to Natural Balance but they were too much for his tummy, but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards. Also, with the all natural ingredients I feel good about rewarding him.<br />(p.s. since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon.)"}
