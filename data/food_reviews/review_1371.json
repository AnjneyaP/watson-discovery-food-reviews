She would not touch it after that.  We donated the rest of the shipment to a shelter.  Hopefully some cats there will like it.  The only thing I can get my cat to eat is Fancy Feast.  I have tried all the organic and grain free brands and she won't touch any of them.  She is an indoor/outdoor cat that we adoted as a one year old who was stray.  I think the only meat she likes besides fancy feast is fresh kill.  If you know some healthy brands that your fussy cat has enjoyed, please write a review or email me if that is an option."}
