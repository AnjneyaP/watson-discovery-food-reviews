This illy cappuccino doesn't have much coffee taste. All I can taste is milk and sugar, making it indistinct from other such coffee beverages like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AHMCA\">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink</a> and competitors. It's good, mind you, but nothing like fresh cappuccino. The can makes it very easy to toss in a bag and take with you on the road or to the office.<br /><br />The can warns you not to shake, but I instinctively shook it immediately upon taking it out of the fridge and it exploded into a small mess! Apparently, pressure can build up inside like a soda, even though this product is not carbonated. 100 calories per can (15 from fat). Made in Denmark, distributed by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />Carrageenan is an emulsifier (keeps fats and liquids from separating) derived from seaweed. Cellulose gum (and I'm guessing cellulose gel) improves viscosity. Potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are pH regulator, used to control acidity. All these are natural and vegan/vegetarian additives common in the food industry. Why can't it just be coffee, milk, and sugar?"}
