It was refreshingly cold on a hot day and gave me that burst of caffeine energy that keeps me going.<br /><br />I enjoyed the taste very much. I like my hot morning coffee with lots of milk and a bit of sugar, and this was similar to how I make it. People who like their coffee black or with milk/cream and no sugar will probably not like this product.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with it, though I doubt I'd buy it often at approximately two bucks a can."}
