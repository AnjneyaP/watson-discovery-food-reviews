ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY (WHICH IS HIGH) FOR THE TREATS THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO ALSO MAKE MONEY OFF ME FOR SHIPPING CHARGES.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5"}
