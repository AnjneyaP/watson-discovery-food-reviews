LOL<br />I received a 50.72 ounce of drinking water to review for Amazon.  I refrigerated it since I prefer to drink my water cold and then also pour it over ice.  What can I tell you?  I don't think it's my imagination when I tell you that it does taste smooth.  It is refreshing and even though I am not a big water drinker I would choose this product again if I had a chance to buy it.<br />Therefore I give it a recommend to buy."}
