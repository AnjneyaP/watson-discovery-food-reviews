Like the other reviewer says, there are alot of peanuts and raisins, but there are plenty of cranberries & almonds in that mix as well. I would say cashews and the yogurt covered raisins (about 15 per package) are what there are the fewest of. For me that's great because im trying to lose weight but i still like the addition of a few yogurt raisins too.<br /><br />All in all 5 stars from me, you wont find a better healthy mix for around $2.50 a bag. If you get melted yogurt raisins from a hot summer delivery, just stick the entire bundled pack in the freezer when you get the package for 30-45 minutes, they come out just like new without damage to nuts."}
