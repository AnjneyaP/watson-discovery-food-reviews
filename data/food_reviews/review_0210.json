Kidding on that part but he actually was attentive to his owner knowing that he would get this treat.  Definitely well for training, especially being all natural and only 2 cals each!  We have the lamb jerky as well, that he may enjoy even more (if possible) however it's not a treat for training due to the size and texture but I recommend those as well.  We start obedience class next week so hopefully they don't lost their magic :)"}
