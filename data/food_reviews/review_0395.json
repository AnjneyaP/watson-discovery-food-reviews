You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!"}
