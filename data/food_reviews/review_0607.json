I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.<br /><br />This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.<br /><br />It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.<br /><br />If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!"}
