Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended."}
