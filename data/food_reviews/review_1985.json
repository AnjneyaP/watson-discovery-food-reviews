While the smell and color are wonderful, we found the Tierra 100% arabica blend to be much more bitter than our regular blend, and even after we added cream or milk to our coffee we felt unable to continue to drink it, so we gave it away after only a few brews (we are straight espresso drinkers otherwise). We have now received our regular Super Crema again and couldn't be happier."}
