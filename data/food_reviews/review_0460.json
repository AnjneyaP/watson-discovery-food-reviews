I love that it's organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy.  I don't notice anything dramatic when I drink it or don't drink it, but I will say I feel nourished when I drink it, and have had NO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WHATSOEVER.  I'm 36, this is my first pregnancy, and I have been exceptionally healthy throughout.  I highly recommend this for any pregnant woman--at least a cup a day!"}
