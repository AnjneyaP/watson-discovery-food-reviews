The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new \"worst\" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me."}
