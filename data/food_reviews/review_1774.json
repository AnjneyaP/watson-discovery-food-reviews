I suppose if you have a food processor and can powder it (as its in sugar-esq crystals on arrival) - or can make a liquid variant. Took off one star for the hassle of having to modify it from its original state for use in cold drinks.<br /><br />That being said, does anyone know if the heat + equal parts sugar / water = liquid sugar method will work with Erythritol? Or will the chemical process be different?"}
