I have had two cats with digestion problems, problems that they liked to make mine! My vet suggested 1/2 jar for a 10 lb or larger cat, 1/4 jar for a less<br />than 10 lb cat...per day or every other day. For some reason this settles their stomachs.<br />And they stopped purging on my carpet or my down comforter! They think it is a kitty treat.<br />I think it is a miracle."}
