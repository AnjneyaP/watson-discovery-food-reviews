It's expensive, and I don't like the extra plastic it creates even though I  always try to find a recycling bin for my empties.  However, there are those days where I forget my water bottle or want more to drink than I carried with me.  For those few days, I'd choose Essentia drinking water as often as I choose spring water even though Essentia comes from municipal sources.  Essentia's silky texture is very cool.  It reminds me of the lake and creek water we drink when out and about in rural Alaska (NOTE: you should NOT drink lake and creek water without verifying its safety).  I chose to try out Essentia since I was curious about the whole 9.5 pH thing.  I don't feel any difference in consuming this pH of water, but did find it nice to drink as water.<br /><br />In short, I can't say I'll be a regular consumer of Essentia since I'm not a regular consumer of bottled water.  But on the few days that I am, this is a choice I'd make."}
