When you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat, this is ideal.  The bottle has a dropper attached to the lid, so it is easy to meter out just the right amount.  Although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle, it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat."}
