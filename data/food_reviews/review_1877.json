It tastes more like ginger ale then an orange drink. I have tried a bunch of flavors but this one is my favorite and it's easy to find elsewhere like publix, vitamin shoppe, and costco... however amazon.com has the best prices! I have tried to workout in the morning without having one and my performance/energy is literally nonexistent. For beachbody workouts like Insanity, Chalean Extreme and now I'm doing TurboFire this is a great energy drink to have that only has 10 calories and no sugar/aspartame. I also like to have one in the afternoon if I need a pick-me-up. I keep wondering if it is too good to be true- I highly recommend!"}
