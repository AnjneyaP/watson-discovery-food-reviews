According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink. especially for our children. But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, and our children definitely will not drink it, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH<br /><br />Now, here is a flavor that I could get use to in a hurry.  This taste was bubbling with flavor and actually brought pleasure to my taste-buds.  It was rich and smooth, yet bursting with excitement at the same time.  It did not leave an after taste that was unpleasant, but left you wanting more.<br />The blending of the flavors in this Switch was excellent and definitely made this taster happy.I had my grandchild take a drink and she absolutely loved it and asked me to go purchase some.  I recommend this flavor. Truly a treat for the taste buds.  Very good."}
