Just as another reviewer said, Yogi Tea's Breathe Deep is phenomenally effective for asthma!<br />I recently moved into a rented house where a cat lived for 7 years; I have cat asthma, and have struggled to regain my normal breathing. I still use my Albuterol inhaler when necessary, and check in with my doctor (read: I'd still recommend traditional medicine), but nothing has worked as well as this tea! I've been drinking 3-4 cups/day, and have noticed a substantial improvement -- not just during the rest of the day, but the following days -- even when I drink only 1 cup. No one can underestimate the feeling of being able to breathe freely. This tea is a lifesaver!"}
