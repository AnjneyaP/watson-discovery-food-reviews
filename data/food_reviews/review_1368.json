My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this \"Edible\" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one."}
