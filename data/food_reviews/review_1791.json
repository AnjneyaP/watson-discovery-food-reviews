I NEED coffee in the morning, so I add this to my coffee, in addition to adding a teaspoon of ground espresso to the cup as well. This has a nice taste to it, not too too sweet & just a bit of a cinnamon-y flavor. Its very good. A little pricey, but buying it in quantity like this saves me a few trips to Whole Foods."}
