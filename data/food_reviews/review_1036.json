I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!"}
