They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza...just chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce.  Haven't tried it yet, but they seem like they'd be REALLY good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the oven.<br /><br />They seem to be a bit more expensive than other Jack Link stuff, but so worth it.
