That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis."}
