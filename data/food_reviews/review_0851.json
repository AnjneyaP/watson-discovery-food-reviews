This dog food was greatly appreciated by the three dogs in my life; they loved it, and would stand around the dog food bowl when it was empty, hoping that it would be filled forthwith.  (That is, when one of the dogs wasn't doing her \"paw trick.\")<br /><br />At any rate, the dogs really enjoyed this food.  And as it is a large bag full of food, if you have three dogs or so, it'll last you at least three weeks if used as directed.  So it's a good value and your dogs will really enjoy it (that is, if they're anything like the three I deal with every day) -- so what's not to like about that?<br /><br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"}
