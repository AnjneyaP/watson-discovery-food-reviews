We blind tested all three and could reliably identify each of them (just checking it wasn't my imagination!). I only received one sample bottle so I can't comment on its claim to 'hydrate better' or any of the supposed health effects, though some other reviewers have noted long-term benefits.<br /><br />I like the oversized bottle - if you're trying to drink more water each day, it's ideal for taking to work to measure how much you're actually drinking. It's a good product though the biggest downside is the cost compared with other bottled waters or home-installed filtration systems."}
