I was having seizures, near-syncope (passing out, but still being somewhat conscious), couldn't breathe, and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I don't usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me, and I was so tired, I didn't even look at the bottle and took it. Please, don't use these!"}
