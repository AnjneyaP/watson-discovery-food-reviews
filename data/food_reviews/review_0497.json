Like most Starbucks coffees this one is very strong and robust, but the hint of vanilla actually helps to cut some of the bitterness.  The vanilla isn't overwhelming and does not leave that unpleasant toothpaste-like aftertaste that some flavored coffees do.  I found that I didn't need to add as much sugar or cream. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and found this more drinkable than Starbucks' traditional or non-flavored blends."}
