So much better than the regular thick rice cakes. They are thin, but very compact, so I use them as a great sandwich bread alternative. They don't break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes. I've searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and can't find this product anywhere. I love that they are now available for Subscription through Amazon.com."}
