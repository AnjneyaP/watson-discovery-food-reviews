Dont know about you but I've I've never had water that wasn't smooth.<br /><br />Kind of like tap water in that it really isnt as tasteless as spring water.  Essentia, according to the label contains potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, as well as spring water.  The label says it's best available ph at 9.5.  (Not a clue what that means.)<br /><br />The label also says it hydrates better.  I'm thinking this may be true as my thirst was quenched with less of Essentia than of regular tap or spring water so I drank less.  Not sure if this is a good thing or not.  Also, I did not have to run to the bathroom in a half hour.  This could be coincidence of course.<br /><br />I have to admit I did feel a bit more energized by Essentia.  Not sure if this was my imagination or just another coincidence.<br /><br />All in all I found Essentia to be a good experience.  I would buy more.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF"}
