One cat is a \"people food\" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch \"people food\" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves \"people food\", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no \"by-products\" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know."}
