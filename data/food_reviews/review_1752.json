Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary. We have found OUR FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. Comes exactly as described by the seller, order promptly processed, arrives quickly. Can't beat it in our opinion. I can recommend this coffee and the seller with confidence."}
