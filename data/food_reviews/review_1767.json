My two year old absolutely LOVES these! He's constantly asking for \"bueberries!\" I used to give him concentrated gummy fruit snacks for a treat, but now he only wants Little Ducks snacks. This of course thrills me! The snacks are 100% certified organic, healthy fruit - just freeze dried. I'm happy to give him as many fruit servings as he wants. You definitely will love this product! The other flavors are great too..."}
