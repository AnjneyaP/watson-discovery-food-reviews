It is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be, you then have to pay for shipping.  Sorry, I would skip them.  My local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  Although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  Whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  Just the price on this site is ridiculous!  Ask your grocer to start carrying them."}
