Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, \"Soft 'n Chewy\" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy. I would say these are just as delicious as Chewy Chips Ahoy cookies, but they are also thicker and usually cheaper. Pick one up today and the people in the house with sweet tooths will gobble them up quickly."}
