I was very disappointed with this candy.  Although these candies are shaped like strawberries, their flavor and scent do not resemble strawberries at all. In addition, the gummi candies lack sweetness.  After sampling several of the strawberries, I am going to throw away the remainder of the bag.  Disgusting!<br /><br />Try the Haribo gummi peaches.  Those candies are wonderful."}
