I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very \"sticky\" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best."}
