Sharp\"","HelpfulnessNumerator":6,"HelpfulnessDenominator":9,"Score":1,"date":"2009-05-03","Summary":"Caveat emptor! Disappointing","Text":"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better."}
