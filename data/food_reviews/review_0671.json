In that respect, this was a disappointment for me, not being as tangeriny enough for me.  The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If I'm going to drink juice, I'll stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated."}
