I can confirm that it does indeed taste good, but my research on pH 9.5 benefits were not conclusive.<br /><br />First of all, it really has high pH level. I have a test kit for my aquarium, and it confirmed that this water's pH is near asserted levels. But when I performed some research whether it really has benefits, I ended up with mixed results.<br /><br />Most majority of water sources (whether tap water, or special ones like Fiji) seems be alkaline (high pH level). And I know that natural water sources that are advertised to have health benefits are also in this area. But they are usually not that high (at least recommended levels are up to 8.5), and they contain beneficial minerals. Essentia lists only a few of them.<br /><br />Drinking such high pH would probably not upset your stomach (since our diets are highly acidic, this would only neutralize it). However I would not recommend it for any other use. For example coffee would not taste right. And it would probably kill your fish in the aquarium.<br /><br />Overall, this is much better than tap water, or regular bottled ones. While I cannot completely vouch for its chemical benefits, most of my research points in that direction. If the price is right (currently it seems to be higher than normal), I would recommend this."}
