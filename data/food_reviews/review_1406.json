The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy.  You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!"}
