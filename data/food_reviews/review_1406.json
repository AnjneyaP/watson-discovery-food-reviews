It is amazing how different types of food can really upset your dogs, especially when they get older.  I also like that they don't stink like bacon.  They have no strong odor, and my dogs really enjoy them.  A lot of people say that they are not for small dogs, and I would agree.  These are more for medium to large dogs.  We have a larger Shih-tzu that liked them and did fine, but maybe even if they were a different shape then the small dogs would do better.  They are currently a large, hard rectangle that can be broken into 2 smaller squares. When the smaller dogs try to eat them, they make a bit of a mess.<br /><br />Even with the size/shape limitations, both of my dogs loved them and ate them right up.  And I would mention that our Shih-tzu is super picky.  I would definitely buy these for my dogs."}
