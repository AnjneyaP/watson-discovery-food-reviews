This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking."}
