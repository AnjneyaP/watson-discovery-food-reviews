Celery just doesn't get it. Our local stores don't regularly carry pork rinds, so I was feeling a little bit left out.<br /><br />But, the Lowry's brand is one I am familiar with and so, I was pretty confident I would like them. They don't pop like popcorn; in fact, they don't make much noise at all when they are cooking. I've found that one minute forty eight seconds seems to be the best time to get the most edible rinds. BUT....one can also reheat the unpopped rinds and a lot of them will then puff up.<br /><br />Enjoy...they are worth it."}
