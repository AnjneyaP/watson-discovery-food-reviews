I was looking for alternative source and Amazon was the to go place. Tried many brands, kids have a bench mark to compare, none of them met their standards. Tried this, they haven't complained about unusual state or smell, I could not agree more.<br /><br />I only wish, Amazon had bigger size bottles. I can always order directly from company store, but its not the same service as Amazon."}
