Reasonable, but not an amazing deal.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I do like the Van whatever flavor French Vanilla K-cups, and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee.<br />I would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, you'll most likely enjoy this one.  If you like it plain and black, you'll probably hate this."}
