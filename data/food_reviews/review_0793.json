The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."}
