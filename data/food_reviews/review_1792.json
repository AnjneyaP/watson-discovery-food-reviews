I am a peanut butter by the spoonful w/ a glass of milk kind of girl and have been dying ever since I started Weight Watchers two months ago. I just heard about this and saw all the great reviews and they are all TRUE! It reminds me of natural peanut butter if I add a drop less water and don't stir it until really smooth. It is HEAVEN! Can't wait to make peanut butter toast, PB&J sandwiches, and heck, I might even eat THIS by the spoonful! ;)"}
