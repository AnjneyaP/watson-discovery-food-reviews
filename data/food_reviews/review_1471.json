I used the recipe on the side for decadent cake and everyone loved it. People didn't know it was gluten/casein free at all. Was flavorful and moist. I ran out of vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk. It made it more chocolatey.<br />For a gluten/casein free chocoholic it was a wonderful treat."}
