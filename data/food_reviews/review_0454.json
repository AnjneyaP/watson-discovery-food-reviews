Not too unique compared to a lot of over the counter canned decaffs already available. But overall, it's a good after dinner type of coffee to serve guests.<br /><br />Price wise, it's reasonable but there are many other comparable products that may have a more distinguished taste. Overall, it's a good product and worth trying for decaff drinkers."}
