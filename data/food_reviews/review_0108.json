It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.It's great without sweeteners.<br /> It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl,long and slender. A little tea goes a long way. Enjoy!"}
