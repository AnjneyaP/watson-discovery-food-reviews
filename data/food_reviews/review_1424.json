Causes a Giant Schnauzer to actually chew!","Text":"I have three dogs. Two miniature schnauzers and a Giant Schnauzer.  I like two things about these biscuits. One is they are a large and hard biscuit, hard enough to forces my Giant Schnauzer to actually take the time and crunch them up rather than down them in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The second thing I like is they are bar type cookie and have an indention in the middle so you can snap them in half for smaller dogs.<br /><br />I haven't seen them for sale at any store yet so after my Vine sample was gone I ordered them here on Amazon and they were shipped by the seller rather quickly."}
