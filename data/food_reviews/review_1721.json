As I have tried the same bars only with chocolate coating.<br />These bars taste horrible.  It is almost a plastic like taste.  I think the shipper did not ship them properly based upon the heat of the summer.  When I took them out of the box they were really warm.<br />Even my children who love most things wont eat them.  So either this is a terrible product or the company shipped these in the heat of the summer and it changed them.  They are horrible.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JG8ALK\">Oskri Coconut Bar, Original, Gluten Free, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 20)</a>"}
