Its so quick and easy to prepare I mix it with oatmeal or cereal and milk. Only downside is each package makes 2.5 oz, and its a bit pricey for me. But the quality of the food is superb! Its worth every penny! I don't use this daily since I make him his food, but this is a great substitute for on the go or last minute quick fix."}
