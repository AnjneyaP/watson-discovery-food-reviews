Really???","Text":"This is no better. . . and no worse than ramen noodles you can pick-up in the store for a LOT less $$.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Comes in in a bowl, so it's easy<br />No MSG (but plenty of other \"stuff\" like Gum Arabic, Malic Acid, Maltodextrin, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Succinate, etc.)<br /><br />Con's:<br />Cost<br />Don't let the picture fool you.  This is a \"serving suggestion\".  There is no chicken in this product.  There is just \"powdered chicken broth\" as well as beef fat. . beef stock. .  and it's less than 2%.<br />Not spicy at all.  If you think this is spicy, then a dash of black pepper must set you on fire!<br />The package shows that this contains 30% less sodium than their \"regular\" products.  Well, this has 890mg of sodium, which is 37% of the recommended daily allowance. . . and it is quite salty. . . so I hate to think what their \"regular\" would taste like. . . and OH. . . if you read the package, one bowl has TWO servings, so that means you're getting 74% of your daily allowance of salt in one bowl of these noodles, which I don't know anyone who is going to eat just a 1/2 bowl.<br />Lots of extra \"stuff\" inside.  See above.<br /><br />Again. . . I think that ALL of these types of noodles are going to be very much the same.  Certainly it's not a healthy item. . but nor is most fast food. . . But it's quick. . . It's easy. . . So once in a while, I'm sure it's fine. . . but you probably don't want to try and live off these.  FYI, there are no vitamins in this product.  None.  Zip.  Zilch."}
