I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the kiwi berry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board."}
