I have several of these that I got for my daughter. She makes her own baby food for our grandchildren. But I have some as well. When the kids come to our home, we keep snacks, fruit, and dry cereal pieces in the cups for the children to enjoy.<br /><br />During the summer we use this to make frozen fruit or yogurt pops. It travels well and cleans up easily. Just an excellent item that I wish had been around when I was a young mom."}
