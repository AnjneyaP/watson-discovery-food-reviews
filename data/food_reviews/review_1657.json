No pesticides/chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.<br /><br />It is produced by CAYKUR (Rize,Black Sea Region,Turkey), Turkey's government enterprise for tea-processing.<br /><br />Caykur's Altinbas is usually priced higher than other Caykur brands.<br /><br />It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for brewing tea."}
