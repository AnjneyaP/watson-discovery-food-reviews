Bitter with a Distinct Aftertaste.","Text":"This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512\">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers."}
