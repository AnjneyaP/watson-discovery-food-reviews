Purchased the 3 pack - My friend saw a review of this on Oprah - Can't find it in stores... so I tried this - It is a bit strong - had to mix in more light mayo with it... I am waiting for my tomatoes to come in for a Tomato and Baconnaise sandwich - that will be the TRUE TEST!!<br />So far my review is this - Not bad -but it is strong. You may have to mix it with more mayo like I did."}
