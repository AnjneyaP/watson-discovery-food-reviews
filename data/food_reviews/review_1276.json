She'd follow me anywhere.  So when I go to leave for work in the morning, she gives me this look like I'm breaking her heart and all my promises to be a good dog owner...until I give her a pupperoni.  Now, the last thing I do each time I hit the bricks is whip out a 'roni and my dog can't wait to see me go!"}
