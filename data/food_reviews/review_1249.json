This is my secret!!","Text":"I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my \"secret ingredient\" in so many things.<br /><br />My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything - eggs, steaks, popcorn (tip - put it in the butter!), chilli, black beans, soups, cooked vegies, tuna salad, guacamole, develed eggs (my fave).  Somehow almost every time I am \"making up\" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre-superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.  Heck - while typing this up I had the thought that the seasoning would make an awsome variation to garlic bread or crostini. Mmm - I might have to try that tonight.  You have to promise not to tell anyone though!"}
