We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings.  But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible.  Its so frustrating (and embarassing that I didn't catch it before putting in the coolers)!"}
