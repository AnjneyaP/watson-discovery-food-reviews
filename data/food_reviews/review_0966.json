First off, the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit I have ever had in my life. I wanted to eat the whole thing. The rest of the fruits tasted delicious. The unsweetened yogurt was good, the orange juice amazing, and the beer much sweeter. The goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor. Over all, a very fun and effective flavor changing experience!"}
