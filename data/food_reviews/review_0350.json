It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack."}
