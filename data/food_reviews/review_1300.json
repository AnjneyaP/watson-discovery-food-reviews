I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!"}
