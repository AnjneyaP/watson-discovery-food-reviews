(somewhat)","Text":"I've never been a big \"health nut\" and but when a \"health nut\" friend of mine had me try a Zico coconut water drink (plain) I was under the continued opinion that stuff that's \"healthy\" for us isn't healthy for the tongue (i.e. taste).  It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first \"health drink\".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.  So as I said TRY it before they run out."}
