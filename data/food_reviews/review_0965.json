Best microwavable chili on the market.  Used to be able to get it in local grocery stores, but haven't seen any there for a long time now.  Don't know why.  Glad to find it available on-line.  Just the right amount of spices.  Lively flavor without trying to burn out your taste buds.  Only good Campbell's lean meat used."}
