I use it in many things but I tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as Cakes and Muffins. I make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for! I would highly recommend this flour to any baker, even more for the gluten-intolerant ones. I use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour. It always turns out fantastic!"}
