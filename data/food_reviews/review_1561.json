While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.  I tried the chocolate version and found it a little too dry for my taste, but similarly well flavored."}
