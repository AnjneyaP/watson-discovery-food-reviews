I add a tiny bit of butter to mine, but don't need it. My nine year old daughter didn't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this. After a few bites, she consumed half the bowl!<br /><br />I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL, so I didn't have to pay shipping costs, but when it's gone, I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here."}
