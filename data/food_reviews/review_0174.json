They do not crumble and a dog can eat them quickly and easily.  A dog will not lose focus since he won't have to stop and eat.  I actually cut them in quarters for agility class.<br /><br />As far as flavors, my dogs will eat anything.  From the owner's perspective, the salmon smell so much better than the chicken.  The chicken has a typical dog food meat smell, but the salmon does not smell like dog food at all."}
