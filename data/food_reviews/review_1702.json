I do, however, buy a lot of sports drinks for drinking while cycling and working out.  I wasn't sure how to review plain ol' water, but I decided just to compare it with the water I get out of my faucet.  The Essentia does indeed have a better taste to it.  By comparison, my tap water has a slightly bitter taste (I'm guessing from chlorine or other chemicals added to purify it).  Essentia's water really has no taste, which is actually a good thing.  I'm not sure of the benefits its pH balance has for your body.  The addition of electrolytes does mean this product can do more for you than plain tap water if you're working out and losing a lot of water through sweat.  If you won't miss the sugary taste of a sports drink, this is a good zero-calorie alternative."}
