I don't like overly sweet drinks. Illy Issimo Cappucino is great! It is very comparable in taste to Starbucks Bottles Frappucino in the Coffee Flavor. Only, this little can has half the calories of the Starbucks drink and half the sugar. (Without losing anything to taste and no artificial sweetener.) I'd say that is a big win!<br /><br />One can contains 81 mg of caffeine. 100 calories. 1.5g fat. 5 mg cholesterol. 60 mg sodium. 19 g carbs. 4g protein. 10% RDV calcium."}
