I am glad I got the sample size of this one as it is the worst of the lot so far. It tastes super bitter, although, I did not mix fruit with it like the directions say, so perhaps it would be better with fruit. It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein. Compared to the other shakes I've been trying, it has the least amount by % weight.<br /><br />I think that it's unfair for the marketers to put delicious in the label as it is far from delicious."}
