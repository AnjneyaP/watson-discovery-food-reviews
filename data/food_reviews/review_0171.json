So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.  PS: the flavors are OK but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the Jersey Turnpike."}
