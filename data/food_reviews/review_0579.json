There were LOTS and LOTS of long, supple black vanilla beans.  They smelled great and were very pliable.  I immediatley made some vanilla sugar, which 3 weeks into it, smells wonderful.  I intend to add beans to vodka for extract.  I also added several beans to oil to make a wonderful vanilla oil for salads.  There are so many beans, I will make a few gift budles wrapped in raffia for my family and friends.  The leftovers seem to be keeping quite nicely in my room temp pantry. I just need more ideas for the rest of the beans."}
