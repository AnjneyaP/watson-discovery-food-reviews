The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.<br />I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.<br />Enjoy!"}
