Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.  I like the ingredients, nothing fancy, just good stuff for dogs.  I will be buying these again."}
