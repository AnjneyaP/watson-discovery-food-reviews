This is the only thing he visibly appreciates; BTW, when offered Chicken Happy Hips of the same brand he's not as interested.<br /><br />The only downside is the price; don't ever buy it in retail stores - they charge 2-3 times more than online retailers. Even then it's rather expensive.<br /><br />Hope this helps."}
