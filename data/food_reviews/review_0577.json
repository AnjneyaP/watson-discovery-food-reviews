The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28-32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there."}
