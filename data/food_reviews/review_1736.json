Many times I crave a good sweet and I feel deprived.  Now that I found this brownie mix I make a patch, freeze them in individual servings, and have one brownie a day. The recipe is easy and the brownies are rich and flavorable. They're a chocolate lovers answer to having a yummy snack and staying gluten free.  I love them."}
