She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny."}
