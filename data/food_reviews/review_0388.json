You can find many recipes that use it with a google term like \"ras el hanout lamb recipe\".  Note that it is sometimes spelled \"ras el hanoud\", so you can find even more using that.<br /><br />I first found this at the famous (and expensive) spice market in Istanbul.  This blend from Angelina's is nearly as good.  Note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend, and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation."}
