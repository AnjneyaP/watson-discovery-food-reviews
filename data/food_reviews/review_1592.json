(Peruvian Chicken Soup)  This was one of the very best soups I have ever tasted in my forty seven years on this earth.  My mom told me that the Aji Amarillo was the key ingredient to this recipe.  Upon my return home, I ordered two jars.  Sadly, my cat knocked over and destroyed one of the jars.  I just made a batch of that awesome soup last night and it's a hit with my husband and sister.  I will now look forward to my 5 jar order and will find more recipes to use this 'magical' pepper paste.  Truly a must have for the kitchen!"}
