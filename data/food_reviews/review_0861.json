It's easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which, in my opinion is not bland at all.  It's such a delicious cup of coffee.  I have told everyone about these, I've even converted Green Mountain lovers over to Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive brand.  If you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious, but not too robust or bold, this coffee is for you.  I have tried MANY K-cup brands, Tully's, Green Mountain, Emeril's, Donut Shop, etc... and this brand is equal to Green Mountain, possibly even a bit BETTER. :)"}
