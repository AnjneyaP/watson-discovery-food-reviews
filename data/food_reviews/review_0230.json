Shocked!","Text":"Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU\">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again \"Buyer Beware!!\"<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! How's that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!!"}
