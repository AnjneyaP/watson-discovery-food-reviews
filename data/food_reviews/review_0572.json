I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again."}
