It was not bitter, had a good, real coffee taste, and the sugar was sweet without being overwhelming.<br /><br />I think Issimo's ingredients (and I also tried Issimo's milkless <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> drink) are high quality. I drink high-end coffee, and this tasted similar, with the addition of milk, of course. I preferred this drink to the Caffe, though that one was okay too.<br /><br />The taste is smooth and it does not leave a bitter aftertaste that I often associate with these iced coffee drinks. It does not taste like a child's version of coffee where they throw in a lot of sugar.<br /><br />So - Tasted good, with an adult level of sweetness, low calories and a good portion! I might get it again for summer days when even I can't take hot coffee."}
