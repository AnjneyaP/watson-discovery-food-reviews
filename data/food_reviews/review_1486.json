But what a surprise! It turned out to be a strange, thin, \"milky drink\". The low-fat milk taste dominates, and the coffee and cocoa flavors seem barely there. At least the drink does not taste sugary, as does the otherwise quite decent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">ILLY ISSIMO \"Caff&egrave;\"</a> alternative. However, this larger-sized \"Cappuccino\" actually has far more sugar, at 18g.<br /><br />I do not know whether this canned coffee product is supposed to be consumed hot, chilled, or at room temperature. The can includes a \"do not shake\" warning, but has no other instructions. I tried the product after chilling for one day in the refrigerator, and after warming in a microwave-safe cup. It tasted about the same both ways. Perhaps it was a little better hot, but it came out of the microwave with an \"unmixed instant coffee\" swirl on top.<br /><br />This \"Italian espresso-style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa\" certainly did not convert me to canned coffee drinks, especially ones with 100 calories in a single 8.45 fl. oz. can. Because this ILLY ISSIMO \"Cappuccino\" tastes odd, and mostly like milk, I award it 2 stars on Amazon's scale (\"I don't like it\")."}
