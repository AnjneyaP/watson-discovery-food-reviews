Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct \"plasticy\" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way."}
