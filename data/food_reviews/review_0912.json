It tastes fresh, pure and delicious. It's excellent for re-hydration, especially after sports, while pregnant, in labor, or just during the hot summer months.<br /><br />The tetra bottles are large, great for stashing in the refrigerator and using throughout the day.<br /><br />I typically buy another brand, but I'm glad I decided to try ZICO this time. The only ingredient in this particular item is coconut water, and it's not from concentrate."}
