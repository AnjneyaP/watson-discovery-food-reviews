That cream and sugar taste is pretty strong, reminds a little of sweetened condensed milk. The drink also has a powdery/chalky finish, probably due to the cocoa powder. I also noticed a metallic aftertaste. Mostly, just a lot of not very appealing flavors and textures coming together into a sugar bomb that was not very pleasant. Taste varies, but I would not drink it again."}
