But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!"}
