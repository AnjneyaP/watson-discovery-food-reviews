To me it tastes more like a cold mocha than a cappucino.  Taste is relative (and surely based in part on what we're accustomed to drinking); I like it (and normally Peet's Italian Roast is my drink of choice).  But thanks to the calorie count, for me at least, it's a sometime treat and not a morning ritual.<br /><br />For those who choose to drink it regularly, the fact that it's preservative free and the lowfat milk is rBST-free should be a bonus.  Although this does mean that the cans are labeled with expiration dates.  And the 'do not shake' admonition does not indicate that the drink is carbonated; it's full almost to the brim and shaking causes the sugary milk to spew.<br /><br />The Cappucino Coffee Drink is most flavorful when served cold, and, be warned, those who choose to plop in a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an afternoon pick-me-up had best share."}
