Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the \"old\" (with BPA) or the \"new\" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the \"old\" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!"}
