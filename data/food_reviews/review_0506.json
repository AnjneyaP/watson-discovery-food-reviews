The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a \"bone\" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesn't the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasn't worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe"}
