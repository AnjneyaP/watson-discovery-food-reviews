I had tried some other bars that were more fruity and had some sugar crashes. The larabars did not cause that effect on me. I have tried many of the flavors and find them surprisingly delicious for something so healthy. The cinnamon roll, cashew cookie, apple pie, and gingersnap are my favorites so far. The cherry pie was too cherry for me. This is a snack you can feel good about eating!"}
