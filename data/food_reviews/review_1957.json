So, just purchased this one for our Home Bar downstairs. No problems. Can't stand those people who complain about the cup amount.....they obviously don't take the time to read the FEATURES area but then take time to write a complaint. AND, those who complain about the noise (it's minimal) as the water is pushed thru the pod really do need to CUT DOWN on their coffee intake. Great product!"}
