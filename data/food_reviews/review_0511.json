Unfortunately, I don't love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn't deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice."}
