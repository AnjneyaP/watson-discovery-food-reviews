Recently, this syrup is no longer available in Delaware so I was glad to find it on Amazon.com.  Although it arrived in plastic bottles instead of the traditional glass bottles, the taste (quality) remains the same.  I ordered a six pack and only have 2 as family and friends grabbed bottles as I opened the package."}
