I put it in the refrigerator and after it was cold took it out and automatically shook it up - it DOES say DO NOT shake, so it fizzed out a bit. It has an enjoyable coffee taste and does not taste like it came from a can.<br />I liked this drink - it was refreshing and if you like coffee, this is a nice summer drink."}
