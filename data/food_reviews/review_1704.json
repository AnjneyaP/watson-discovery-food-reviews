Thankfully, that is not the case with this water, in regards to taste.<br /><br />  The bottle doesn't really say how many times it has been purified, and what process it uses to purify the water, but it does state it is Alkalized, which is supposed to be very good for your body.  I have a local Asian restaurant where all of their water (they do this themselves, they have a purifier and what-not) is purified through reverse osmosis and is then Alkalized, which they say, has been known to cure illnesses in countries like Japan for a very long time.  Water processed that way does have a pretty good taste.<br /><br />  I would have to say, although this water may seen expensive, it really isn't, the bottles are a little smaller then two liters, so they last a while, as well as the way it is processed as well.  Since the bottles are so large, this is more of a water you would drink around the house rather than take on the go with you, unless, say it was at work or in your car.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"}
