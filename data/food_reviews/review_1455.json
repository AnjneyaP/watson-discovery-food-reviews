But I have struggled slightly with the weaker coffees of K-Cups. I like my coffee with a pretty strong flavor.<br /><br />But today I am sitting here with my first cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold and can say, it is stronger than most but also feels rich in flavor, instead of bitter. It's very good!<br /><br />As far as shipping it arrived right on schedule, although the 50 K-Cups come loose in a large unlabeled  box, which was... odd. I just did a quick count to make sure they were all there and in good shape, which they were, and I just restocked a smaller K-Cup box in my cupboard. No big deal to me.<br /><br />While gambling with your $30 to pick a good coffee, I bet you'll win with this one."}
