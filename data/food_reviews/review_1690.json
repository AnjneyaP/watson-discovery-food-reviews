It's a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn't have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).<br /><br />It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I'm glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again."}
