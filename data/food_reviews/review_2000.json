I wish it were a little heavier on the spices. However, of all the instant chai I've tried, this was the best. Which is why I'll be sticking to brewing my own. Because as convenient as this product is, there are major drawbacks:<br /><br />1. It has a strange aftertaste. It coats your tongue a bit (sort of like a fat compound that was cheaply processed). Reminds me of icing made with shortening...a slightly waxy residue remains after each swallow.<br /><br />2. The powder never fully dissolves. A big issue. And we're not talking about a slight residue. You can see the granules floating as you stir and stir and stir. When you get down to the bottom of the mug, several millimeters of powder have accumulated into a brown sludge. The only time I've been successful with getting this to fully dissolve was by bringing it to a boil and sustaining it for several minutes. Even then, there was residue at the bottom of the mug. My coffee and cocoa don't do this, so I'm wondering why Oregon Chai mix does."}
