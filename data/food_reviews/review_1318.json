For a starting poing, I consider Pike Place Roast from Starbucks to be a four star under this system with Jamaican Blue Mountain being the epitome of five star coffee.<br /><br />I tried the Classique at regular strength and thought it to be watery with a long lasting aftertaste - not a good combination.  At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained - slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)<br /><br />In conclusion, not a \"horrible\" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary - with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.  Not for me, and i would not recommend.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"}
