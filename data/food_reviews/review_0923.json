When I saw the chocolate flavor, I couldn't imagine how coconut water and chocolate could go together in such a way that it would be something that I would really enjoy drinking. Boy was I wrong! After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It is sooooooooo delicious! How could they make something taste this good out of combining coconut water and dark chocolate? I don't know but I will be coming back for more as I just increased my delivery rate on my Subscribe and Save plan. This is a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving - it tastes so indulgent, get rehydrated, and it's good for you! ZICO really outdid themselves with this one. I highly recommend this product!!!"}
