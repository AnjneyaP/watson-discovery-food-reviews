I've been having issues with my standard \"Donut Shop\" K-cups not waking me up.  After one cup of Fog Chaser, I was wide awake.  The stuff tastes good too. My wife, who drinks less coffee than me described it as \"Good Diner Coffee\".  The only thing is I recommend storing them in Zip Lock bags (like other people have suggested)."}
