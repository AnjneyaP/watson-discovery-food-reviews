The \"Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings\" serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them.  They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour - of course they don't.  But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes, these are a great, quick snack."}
