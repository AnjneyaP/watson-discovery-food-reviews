Water is very hot, so some room temp water does not make a difference in the taste.<br /><br />Quiet when brewing and the removable tray makes it easy to use tall cups with their ice brew teas.<br /><br />Would be five stars if had more brew size options...which you can get if you spend more $$$$.<br /><br />..and...the K Cup patent runs out this September, so the cost of coffee per cup should drop this year!"}
