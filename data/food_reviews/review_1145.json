Maple syrup is just wonderful with breakfast or as a sweetener in cooking. I had never had grade B maple syrup but recently decided to try it because it's a few dollars cheaper. Turns out I love it just as much if not more than the grade A syrup I was used to. It's not graded by quality like some foods, but rather by the color. Grade B is darker and has a stronger flavor. If you like one you'll like the other, and you'll like this Anderson's maple syrup. With Amazon's subscribe and save it's a much better deal than buying at my grocery store."}
