I am running a BlueBird into the Icicle into Logic 9 and the sound I am getting is tremendous. There's little to no noise, but it boosts the signal plenty. I've had no trouble with not having enough gain, I have plenty of sound. Another thing is that I don't think it feels as light and toy-like as a lot of people here have stated. Just treat it with care, and don't drop it like any piece of musical equipment. Fantastic buy for the money, recommended."}
