I was so glad to see Amazon has them cheaper.  They're delicious and healthy.<br /><br />Kind Bars come in seveal flavors, but the Cranberry Almond is the only one with low glycemic index.  That's very important!  I don't feel guilty at all when I eat one.  Yummy and healthy.  What could be better.  And they're gluten free."}
