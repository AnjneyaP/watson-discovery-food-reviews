Three sample fortunes are:  \"Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.\"  \"Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.\"  \"If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.\"  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  \"Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,\" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  \"Beware the dog in the corner house,\" would be fun to get.  \"Life is a wiggle\" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."}
