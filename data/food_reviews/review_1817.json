I use it all the time, in all sorts of con-coctions.  is that a word??  Anyway,  if you like pb but can't handle the 18 grams of fat per serving, then this stuff is for you.<br /><br />The price as of 9/12/2011, on amazon at 8 bucks is riduclous.  don't pay any more than 4 bucks from other vendors.<br /><br />Enjoy."}
