Maldon was the fave of all of three of us - it has an amazing balance and you don't feel you've consumed too much salt, which couldn't be said for the other salts we sampled. I'm buying this 'coz my teenage daughter, who was at the restaurant with me, enjoyed the salt so much (and we are a virtually salt-free family) she feels we need to have this as a staple in our home!"}
