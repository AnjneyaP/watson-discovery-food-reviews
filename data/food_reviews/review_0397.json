We both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash.  It is a little pricey here, basically comparable to store prices (Walmart/Supermarket).  I order for convenience, one less item I have to waste time at a store getting---with our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from Amazon, mostly through the Subscribe and Save program."}
