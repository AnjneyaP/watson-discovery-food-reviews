Whether that was science or a placebo effect, I don't know.  I have tried a variety of different brands of bottled water and I thought this one had a nice, clean taste and I would pick it over the majority of others that I've tried.  I refrigerated it before drinking it as I prefer cold water.  I can't handle drinking tap water so we had to put a filter on our water at home.  This water tastes as good as our filtered water with the added bonus of electrolytes and best available pH at 9.5.<br />This 1.5 liter is the size I would order.  Perfect size to get through a day of work or to put in the backpack for a hike."}
