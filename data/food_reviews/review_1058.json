Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and you're done.  A good, quick, hot lunch when you're in a hurry.  But don't eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you.  OK once in awhile, though, unless you're on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)<br /><br />Tip:  You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies.  Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.<br /><br />Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot."}
