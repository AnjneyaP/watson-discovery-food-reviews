The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.<br />Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.<br />But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -<br />and a great price with Amazon."}
