Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that \"Almond\" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to \"Buttery French Toast\", as this would be much better fitting."}
