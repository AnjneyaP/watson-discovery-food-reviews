Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that \"oven roasted\" + \"honey\" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me."}
