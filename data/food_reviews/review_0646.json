The best thing is that they are healthy. They are vegan, so no dairy, eggs or other animal products. They are also fruit juice sweetened and made with whole grains. Absolutely nothing artifical. They have little chocolate chips in them and taste yummy! I'm so glad that Amazon carries them because they are much cheaper to buy by the case then at local health food stores or through the company website."}
