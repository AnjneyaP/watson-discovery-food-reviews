My son has autism and is an extremely picky eater. Having food allergies made his food choices even harder! Your product is healthy and so convenient, when your taking a lot of your own food everywhere.  Not to mention delicious!! Thanks again for putting the fun & joy back into eating cookies for my little guy & for so many others! Wishing you much sweet success."}
