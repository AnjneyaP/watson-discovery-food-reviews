I am a big fan of jelly beans and these are now my favorite, perfect mix of flavors (good and...mysterious). I like to put them out in a little bowl, just randomly, before any company comes over...what's more enticing than a nice bowl full of bright jelly beans sitting out, ripe for the picking! That is until your unsuspecting guests \"roll the dice\", grab a few and perhaps \"enjoy\" some toothpaste & pencil shavings!!"}
