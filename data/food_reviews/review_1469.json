It was better than bottled Starbuck's to me.  I'm not big, big on store type coffee drinks either, although I like them very well fresh-  but this one was good - it let the coffee shine though, which was full bodied in flavor.  There was just a hint of cocoa and it wasn't so sweet that I felt like I was drinking something that should be a milk shake.  It was a good COFFEE drink.  I got a bit of pick me up from the caffeine as well.  It didn't last long enough though - it was gone too fast - I think it would be better as a 12 ounce drink!"}
