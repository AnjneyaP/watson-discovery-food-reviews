I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were \"weird\" and \"different\".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."}
