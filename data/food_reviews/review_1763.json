We have only been able to find it for purchase on the East Coast, so I ordered it through amazon for Christmas.  Boy was she surprised!  This made an excellent gift as well as an excellent drink....just add any booze..it's wonderful!  Does not upset my stomach like pre-mixed sweet-n-sour - that stuff that comes in the bottle..this is WAY better"}
