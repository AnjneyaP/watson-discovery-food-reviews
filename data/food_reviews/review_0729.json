I bought the 6-pack variety and have tried the Maple Cinnamon and the Onion Garlic. I generally like flax, but these just aren't setting well with me even when I use them as a carrier for dips. I feel I wasted my money. I'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend's family that are gluten free."}
