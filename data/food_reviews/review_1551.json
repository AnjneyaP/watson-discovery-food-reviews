I have tried most of the larabar flavors and the taste and texture are delicious with all the flavors I have tried.  This is my absoulte fav with only 5 all natural ingredients.  My second choice is the pecan pie larabar.  Almost as good as this one.  I eat one for breakfast and then follow with a light mid-morning snack."}
