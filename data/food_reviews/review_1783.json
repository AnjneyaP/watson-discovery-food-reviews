They entertain her for weeks and she loves to gnaw on them more than any of her toys.  I couldn't find them locally so I was thrilled to find them thru Amazon.  I ordered half a dozen and should last us @ a year!  Seller shipped so quickly!  Very pleased with the product and with the service!  Thank YOU!"}
