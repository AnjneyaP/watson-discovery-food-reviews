(We didn't tell the young fellow that these qualify as healthy food.)All three of us commented on the rich and complicated taste. One loved coconut, another chocolate chips, and myself, well, the chewy and filling sensation eating the bar itself. The opinion of each was positive. We recommend to you Pamela's products."}
