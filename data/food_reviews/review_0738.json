Yes, diabetics can eat it because it's only half (or less) the blood sugar elevating agent of the same volume of 'real' sugar. It's also why it tastes like 'real' sugar and can be cooked unlike some sugar sustitutes. A lot of non-sucrose-based sweetners are destroyed by heat.<br /><br />What I've found with this Splenda brown sugar is, even though it's bulked up so that it's supposed to be equivalent in volume to all-sucrose, it's really very, very sweet so I do not substitute it 1:1 for sugar. I use much less than I would real sugar."}
