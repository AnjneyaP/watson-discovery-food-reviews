I tried other coconut waters and then read how Zico was the best to do what it said it would.  I searched and found the chocolate coconut water and tried it.  Now, I am addicted, it is absolutely delicious.  Great chocolate taste, REAL chocolate taste and not too sweet. It is great just as a pick-me-up chocolate need, that is good for you.  I have both the regular coconut water and the chocolate.  It is a treat!"}
