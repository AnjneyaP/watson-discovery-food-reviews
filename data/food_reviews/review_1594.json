Unlike many hot sauces that focus on the burn, this hot sauce has a fantastic flavor and still has a kick!  I'm a big wuss when it comes to hot sauce, but I suffer gladly for the great garlicky flavor of this sauce.  It's very difficult to find in stores, but if you ever see it, it's worth trying!"}
