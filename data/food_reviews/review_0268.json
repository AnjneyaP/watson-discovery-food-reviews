One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free."}
