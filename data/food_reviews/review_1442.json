It's dirt cheap!!!  I just saved my old McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice jar, and now I refill it from these bags.  This method makes these prices unbeatable!!!<br /><br />Okay the spice itself:  it is good.  Not great, but not a problem at all.  It's considerably milder than McCormick's.  So, to compensate, depending on what I'm making, I simply modify the quantity of spice.  I use about 50% more of this than I would with McCormick's PP Spice.  In any case, this brand is so inexpensive, it's still a good bargain.  And the flavor is great!!!  Just know that it is a little bit mild, and it will work great for you!"}
