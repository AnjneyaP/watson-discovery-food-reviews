In its defense, not only is this water good for rehydration after exercise, but for the times when one is sick and requiring an infusion of electrolytes, I would choose this product over another \"sports\" drink in a heartbeat.  Will keep a bottle on hand for emergencies, but at the current high cost, I will not purchase for daily consumption."}
