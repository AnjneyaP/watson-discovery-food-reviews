I expect to get its replacement from the people at Blue sometime today.  So, what's a month, anyway?  The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  That's always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe I'll like it.  Blue's products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally."}
