The 5 stars is for the product, because mine arrived like the picture above with a few pillows, not enough to keep things from roaming in the box. All had crumbs in them, but I saved them in an airtight container for later use.<br />Amazon what's up with the packers?  I received a case of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V0PXNU\">Bisto Gravy Granules for Chicken - 12pk x 170g</a> and they were shrink wrapped together and had so many pillows an ant could not get in, nothing short of stepping on them could hurt these anyway. So why are the fragile cookies left to roll around in the box???"}
