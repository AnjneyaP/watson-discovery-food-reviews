It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called \"Pouchkine\" or \"Afternoon Earl Grey\" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)."}
