I tried the \"energy\" bars and \"nutrition\" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar."}
