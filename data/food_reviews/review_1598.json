I will agree their taste can be a bit much, think of a garlicky artificial taste that would be on chips.  To be honest, this defeats the purpose of a roasted walnut, where you would think its roasted and perhaps has salt on them.  Granted these aren't awful, but after eating a container I'm not really sure if I would consider them good.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- One of the few \"roasted\" walnut options I've seen<br />- The taste is ok, but not great<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- These do not taste like the walnuts found in Emerald's deluxe mixed nuts canisters, if thats what you are looking for<br />- The taste can be a bit much, its ok, but if you are looking for a plain roasted walnut this isn't it<br />- Not to nitpick but these are mostly walnut pieces, not many whole walnuts<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />- I don't think I would get them again<br />- I would suggest not buying a 6 pack until you try them first because they aren't just simple roasted walnuts"}
