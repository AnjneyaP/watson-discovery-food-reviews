This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water): apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. The beverage also includes gum acacia and soy.<br /><br />Despite the fact that there are no added sugars, the calorie and carb counts are quite high - in fact higher than an average soda. An 8.3 ounce can contains 140 calories and 36g carbs."}
