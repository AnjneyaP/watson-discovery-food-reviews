They came in a Christmas gift basket, but I liked them so much that I had to google them to see how to get more.  This variety contains oregano, poppyseed, and garlic powder.  Because of how thin they are, there's nowhere for the flavor to hide!  Try them with smoked provolone.  I highly recommend them."}
