Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have."}
