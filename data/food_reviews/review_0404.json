At only 100 calories per serving/350 calories for the bag, you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.<br /><br />There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.<br /><br />So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase, re-ordering."}
