Neely","HelpfulnessNumerator":2,"HelpfulnessDenominator":2,"Score":4,"date":"2012-01-30","Summary":"Dogs love them, but pieces aren't sized uniformly and they melt when wet","Text":"I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the \"special\" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as \"hypnotic\" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart."}
