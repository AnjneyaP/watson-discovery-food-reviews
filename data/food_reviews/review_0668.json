I thought it was okay (by I am not a fan of orange sodas); I would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor, like Grape, or Fruit Punch, or Kiwi Berry.<br />I think this is, of course, a much healthier alternative to any regular soda. And judging from my dautgher's and my grandson's experience with it, it would be hit with most kids."}
