I also trust Newman products and have always loved the salad dressings and pasta sauces they make (for me, not my dog :) --top quality.<br />At first, my dog didn't know what to make of the treats, as they are a little different than what he has had in the past, but now he loves them...and by the looks and sounds of it, they are both tasty and crunchy. I will continue to purchase these for my dog."}
