I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no \"melty\" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up."}
