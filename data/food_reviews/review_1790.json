This is all I want now, but to be honest it is a little expensive, especially with shipping always applied. So when it arrives I hide it. I leave the Swiss Mix and the Nestles out, and save this for moments when I just want to indulge myself. I have shared it occasionally, but only when the kids are very, very good. Try it and treat yourself."}
