The aroma is wonderful and the tin is packed to the top.. not 3/4 full like some tea's I have purchased<br />  This is one that is going to be reordered in this house, we all liked it that much.<br />I served this to  a friend who is an avid Tea drinker  ( only the best tea's for her) and she was raving about it and took the name to order for herself.<br />That said it all for me."}
