When your looking for something crunchy that isn't high in calories (a litle high in carbs though) these are amazing and you can have 17 crackers in a serving.  I was buying them at an natural health food store for $2.79 a package.  A much better deal for a case here on Amazon (about 1.00 less per package)"}
