I purchased a bag before as a special treat. It seems almost wrong to put it in a can, but the flavor profile does hold up overall. This is primarily because unlike other canned drinks, this coffee is not super sweet or filled with strange ingredients. It has a little sugar, milk, and cocoa, none of which overpower the coffee, but instead balance it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of iced coffee with sugar and cream, you will likely enjoy this brand.  It is more coffee than dessert."}
