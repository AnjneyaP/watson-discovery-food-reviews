That said,  she has two large dogs.<br />So, they didn't like it at all,  and wouldn't touch it unless there wasn't  anything left in the house for them to eat,  Then they ate it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if they don't like this type,  flavor,  or brand,  or just aren't very fond of biscuits.  They don't seem to have too much of a problem with the milk bone brand biscuits.  Dogs are fussy,  it's really hard to find treats for dogs.<br /><br />Mine like chicken strips... And sweat potato sticks.  Greenies,  haven't really found much else.  Chicken flavor pup er ronie. Don't like beggan strips, love anything duck....  Does this give you a better idea of what my dogs taste buds are like?  Your dog may be different,  I dont know if you can really judge by what our dogs like.<br /><br />I'll rate it 3 stars since they ate it,  just not as a first option."}
