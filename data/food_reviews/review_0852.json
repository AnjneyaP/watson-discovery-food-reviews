Grains should not even  be in the top six ingredients in dog food, let alone the top ingredient. The lovely image of an ear of corn on the side of the package should give us all a clue. Dogs and cats are frantic for grains, sure, and love to scarf them down, but this is not a good sign. I have a rescue sheltie that was a junk-food junkie (not just grains, but candy in fact fed to him by his original owner) before I got him and needs to stay on healthy food for the sake of his weight and teeth.<br /><br />I wish I'd looked at the ingredient label before ordering this on Vine, this is not suitable for my dog, or anyone's in my opinion.<br /><br />Benefil does have beautiful packaging and an excellent top closure. But I don't want to pick up up the giant \"fluffy floaters\" produced by a corn-heavy dog diet, nor do I want my dog to suffer digestive system pressure while processing this food. I gave my dog 1/2 cup of Benefil and then threw in the towel given the immediate fluffy-floaters produced.<br /><br />Purina should go back to the drawing board on this one."}
