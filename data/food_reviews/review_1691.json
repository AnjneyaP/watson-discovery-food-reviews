I wanted to give this water a chance and not compare it to those brands so, I drank it and monitored myself to see if there were any added benefits but there wasn't.<br /><br />The added electrolytes came in handy when I was on the treadmill and it seemed to re-hydrate me almost immediately without any extra calories that I would usually take in if I drank a sports drink. The water was smooth but I didn't really care for the taste. The water didn't give me any other benefits other than quickly re-hydrating my body and that's a good thing for me. I would drink this rather than sports drinks, but other than that I don't know if it is doing my body any good."}
