The difference in taste to regular anchovies & these salted one ones is like the difference of filet mignon to a fast food hamburger...unless you LIKE fast food...<br />It may seem expensive to buy this many, however, they last indefinitely, and one will usually take the place of a whole can of the grocery store variety.<br />Yum!"}
