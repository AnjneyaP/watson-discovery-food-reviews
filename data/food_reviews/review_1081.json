It's Good, Creamy Peanut Butter","Text":"This is just like the smooth, reduced fat Skippy peanut butter you would buy in stores.<br /><br />These are the \"small\" 16.3 ounce size, but the price is a good deal - or at least it was when I bought it.<br /><br />Sure, even reduced fat peanut butter is not the healthiest thing on earth, but it's certainly healthier than some of the alternatives."}
