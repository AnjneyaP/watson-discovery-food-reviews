The tin mints are awful, though they taste good. The roll mints are much better... BUT sometimes you will get a batch that is low on the spice included, but that only rarely happens. Usually, they are very very good... and completely natural ingredients, unlike Altoids that is now coloring all their mints except peppermint with artificial coloring and flavors."}
