Since I must be on a high fiber diet due to a colon problem, I tried them. After the first box, I was \"hooked\". These are the best tasting fiber bars I've ever had. The ones in the markets are good, but Kind Bars are the best. I use them as a once a day snack or desert. If I use it as a snack, I follow with 8 oz., water. I feel as satisfied as if I had a full meal. My favorite is almonds and cranberry. They are not too sweet, but just right for my taste. Another thing that I like about them is, they are moist and the nuts are easy to chew, not hard. If you like nuts, cranberries and honey, you'll love Kind Bars. MAK"}
