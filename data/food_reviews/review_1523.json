Too often, in my experience, Gluten-Free bars are either cardboard-like or have odd tastes.  Not so with these.  They are rich and the flavors are really nice. It's almost like eating a candy bar. They arent' huge bars, but they are quite satisfying.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are a bit high in calories for the size - 180 with 9g of fat.  So it's not a 100-calorie snack bar.  They do, however, provide 4% of daily iron, which is a nice plus with a snack bar."}
