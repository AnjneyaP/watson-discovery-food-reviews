They are not the color of chestnuts, plus they are wet in the package and the taste and texture is way off.  I had to order 24 packs of them and they are not-returnable and yet I cannot even finish the first pack.  I would really suggest either get your chestnuts fresh and roast them yourselves or do without because if you are like me who has been roasting and enjoying for 50+ years you will be terribly disappointed."}
