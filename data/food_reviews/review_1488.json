I put mine in the refrigerator over night and had it cold. It was delicious as a morning start-up drink. I could taste the milk and espresso in it and all I missed were the visuals - the foamy milk on top and the splash of brown espresso mixed in with it. Otherwise, it is a great substitution for the fresh drink."}
