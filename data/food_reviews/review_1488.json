I like the consistency and flavor of a high fat cream product mixed with the coffee or espresso based drink (no matter whether it is a hot or cold or frozen espresso based drink). The illy issimo cappucino is made with lowfat milk and indeed it tastes thin and watery.<br /><br />The flavor of this espresso is pretty mild, I think. My favorite coffee is a dark robust french roast. Although this illy issimo drink is made with espresso as a base I'd call it mild but others would say it's medium. I'm a Starbucks lover and I love the cafe au lait New Orleans style coffee with chickory also.<br /><br />I rate this drink 3 stars = It's Okay because for me, it's too thin due to the lowfat milk and it's flavor is not quite bold enough for my palate. If you like lowfat milk in your coffee and if you like mild or medium boldness you will probably like this better than I did."}
