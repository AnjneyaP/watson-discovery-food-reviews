At first I thought this variety was bland and unexciting.  But after going through a few cups of it I look forward to it.  I like the real dried fruit in it, the peaches and raspberries are a good match.  I also like that it's a mix of oatmeal and barley. It adds to the texture of the product.<br /><br />-great to throw in a bag for breakfast at the office. Very convenient - add boiling water and steep several minutes, or add water and microwave the cup!<br /><br />-Great portion size: about the size of two single serve packets of oatmeal all in one<br /><br />-8 grams of fiber per cup and fairly low in sugars<br /><br />-Vegan and fairly non processed"}
