They are oven baked, all natural and extremely tasty.  Biggest problem is they are very hard to find. Almond Pops with Blueberry used to be sold at Costco but no longer. Can't find those anywhere<br />I order often and in volume because my friends all like them too so I share my orders with them<br />Expensive snack but well worth it"}
