No different from regular grocery dog food.","Text":"I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc."}
