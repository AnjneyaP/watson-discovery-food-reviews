I don't want to ruin my machine, so I'm trying different things with this disposable cup, i.e., smaller amount of coffee, packing it looser, and smaller amount of water for cup size.  Still leaks some, but it's getting better as before I had about 3 to 4 areas of dripping water/coffee, some hitting inside the coffee cup and several outside of coffee cup."}
