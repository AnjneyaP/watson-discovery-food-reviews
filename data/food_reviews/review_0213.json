The Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats were perfect for use in training, because they're small, low-calorie, and healthy, so I didn't feel like I was over-feeding her by using them throughout the day.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pixel had a very sensitive stomach when I first got her, these treats never made her sick (her previous \"owner\" had not fed her regularly, she was underweight, and the food she had gotten was of poor quality, so for several weeks after I got her, most foods made her sick).<br /><br />I still use these treats, as they're made from good, simple ingredients, they're free of wheat/corn/soy, and they're low-calorie. Plus, Pixel loves them!<br /><br />A tip for using these tiny treats: I fill a plastic medicine bottle with these treats (they're small, and about 15 will fit in the container), and keep it in my jacket pocket to use while on walks.<br /><br />I also filled a medicine bottle with these and I keep it in the car, which has been useful in two ways. First, it's nice to have a treat for Pixel when she goes in the car. Second, while driving I have encountered my neighbor's escaped dog twice in the past few months, and having treats with me makes it much easier to catch her and return her to her home!"}
