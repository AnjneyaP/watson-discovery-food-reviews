I have a 2 yr old Pit who ate through the souper in 5 minutes.  After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date.  I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat.  Will not be buying this again."}
