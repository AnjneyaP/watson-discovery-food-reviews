Pancake satisfaction at last!","Text":"I was so excited to see gluten-free Bisquick. My grandmother and mother both used it. I fondly remember their strawberry shortcake, so that was the first thing I made. I almost cried, it was so good. I have since made the pancakes (yum yum) and baked chicken. I'm a regular at their web site, liveglutenfreely.com for its great recipes. Thank you, Bisquick!"}
