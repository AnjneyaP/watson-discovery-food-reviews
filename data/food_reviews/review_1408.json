Running around mommy and working I don't eat because I don't have time. Then my steam runs out and I think \"why the hell didn't I eat?\" My mom is a type 1 diabetic and she found these and now she can't keep her hands off of them. She said she doesn't feel hungry as quick. Now my husband has found them. Geez! I have had one package that was a little more gooey but most of the time they are drier tasting. Personally I don't want it to be gooey. I am on a subscription of these through Amazon and I need to increase the amount. My kids haven't tried them...I am sure they are next except they are picky eaters."}
