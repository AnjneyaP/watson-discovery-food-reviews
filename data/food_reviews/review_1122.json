This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them."}
