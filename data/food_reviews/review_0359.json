Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps."}
