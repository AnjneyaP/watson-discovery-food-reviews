We go through a pound of coffee every 5 days. We have ordered from almost every specialty coffee place out there and alot of them were great ones but was always still looking for that certain taste and this one has it!! I am so happy we decided to try this coffee. We are now monthly subscribers. This is also the first review I have ever posted and I have bought quite a bit from Amazon. This coffee is GREAT!"}
