The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream, so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk. (It is slightly reminiscent of a Mounds bar.) I was hoping that this would be more like a coconut-water-with-essence-of-cocoa, but alas this is not the case. Tasty, but not anything like the other Zico products, so be aware."}
