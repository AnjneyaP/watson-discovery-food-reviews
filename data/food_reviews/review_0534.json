It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!"}
