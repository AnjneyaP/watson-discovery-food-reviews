I figured I'd take a chance on them since the price (as of today) is outstanding for raw macadamia nuts at a bit shy of $9 / lb, and I'm glad I did since they're really outstanding.<br /><br />They're extremely fresh with no shell fragments, minimal dust, small nut fragments, etc., from processing and I believe in the whole bag while processing into a vacuum-sealed bag for freezing I only spotted a single macadamia that wasn't whole, and it was itself a fully-intact half nut.  Assuming the price is anywhere close to what it was as of when I ordered this bag when I run out, I'll definitely be reordering these."}
