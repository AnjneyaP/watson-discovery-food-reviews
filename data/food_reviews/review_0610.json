My six bottles of juice were shipped super fast, packaging was very good. The juice itself is excellent. It is actually that rich in taste that I mix it half with water or apple juice. That way the already reasonable price  becomes even better.<br />I am really glad I gave it a try. Drinking a glas of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin."}
