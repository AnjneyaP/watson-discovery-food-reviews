I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This \"Sampler\" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:<br /><br />8 Donut House Regular<br />9 Donut House Decaf<br />7 Donut Shop Regular<br />9 Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Some sample....."}
