It's so well made, not a cheap-feeling tin full of dusty tea.  The excellent quality of this tea was apparent even before filling the teapot: long lustrous leaves with a heavenly aroma.  Use much less tea than the instructions on the package call for: since this tea is very flavorful it does not take much to brew a good cup.  The characteristic Earl Grey flavor is exactly balanced with the strength of the tea flavor.  Recommended without hesitation."}
