Well....<br /><br />1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1<br /><br />2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton<br /><br />Strangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again."}
