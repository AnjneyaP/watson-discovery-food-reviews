Now, don't get me wrong, this is a really good-tasting coffee, but it just doesn't live up to its name, in my opinion.  Also, although one of the ingredients is a sweetener, I really didn't find that the coffee tasted significantly sweetened either.  Overall, it's still a pretty good coffee, but don't buy it expecting much vanilla flavor or sweetness because you will probably be disappointed."}
