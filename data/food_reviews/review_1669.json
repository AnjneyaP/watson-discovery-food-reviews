Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized."}
