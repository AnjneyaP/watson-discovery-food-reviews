No, this is not as good as deep fried fish but it is a darn good substitute.  I cut the fish in small pieces dip them in egg and bread them with Oven Fry.  I cover my cookie sheet with foil, so there are no dishes to wash.  I also put oven fried potatoes in at about the same time.  Then I make a salad to compromise toward a more healthy meal.  It's quick, easy and fairly healthy.  No it's not diet food but it doesn't taste like diet food either.  I just bought a case of Oven Fry from Amazon and am a repeat customer. It has become more and more difficult to find their fish product in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon when these supermarkets quit carrying the products I enjoy."}
