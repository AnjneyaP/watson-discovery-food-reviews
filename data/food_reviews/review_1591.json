They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?<br /><br />Overall, Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!"}
