The fine grind results in a stronger cup off coffee with fewer grounds, meaning the bag lasts longer than a regular bag of coarsely ground beans.  I really can't say aenough about how finely ground it is: it's almost like a powder!  The vaccuum packing also means it's just a bit more fresh when you first open the bag.  Overall - no complaints at all: great tasting, strong-as-you-want-it coffee here."}
