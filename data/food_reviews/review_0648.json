What could be better?.... I bought these because the texture and taste remind me of the Cosmic Brownies I ate when I was a kid, the super unhealthy ones by Little Debbie.  Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Cookie bars are so much healthier and pretty darn close to the real thing(without the fudge topping)... They are delicious and a healthier blast from the past for me! YUMMMMM!"}
