The standard device made by Keurig is so difficult to clean each time, that I just choose to never use it.<br /><br />DisposaKups are the perfect item for brewing my favorite coffees that are not available in K-cup form.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and with a \"snap\" -- I'm able to brew a cup of coffee and still have the disposable feature of regular k-cups (and no clean up!) Plus, you can assemble however many custom K-cups ahead of time with disposaKups, so they are very helpful to have for holiday gatherings and parties.<br /><br />Thank you thank you!  I will be purchasing a big supply soon, so I will be well-stocked for the holidays!"}
