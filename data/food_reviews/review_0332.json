I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you."}
