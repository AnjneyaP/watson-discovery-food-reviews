Slightly Bitter.","Text":"A bold, but not a super bold blend. This coffee has a bitter edge and a bit of an acidic aftertaste, so it is not one of my favorite k-cups.<br /><br />For bold (not hair-raising bold), I prefer <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4\">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> (a favorite) or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFL1Q\">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, French Roast (Dark Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, both of which have a smoother finish and better flavor."}
