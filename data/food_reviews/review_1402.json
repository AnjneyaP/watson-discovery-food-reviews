You feel like you are getting quality food at a good price. That's why I jumped at getting these for my dog when I heard about them.<br /><br />They are the same consistency as \"Milk Bones\" maybe a little denser. They come in around 1\"x 2\"x 1/4\", they can be easily broken in two because of a seam in the middle. I have a minature Maltese and they are kind of big for him but I just break it into quarters for him which is a little hard to do but it can be done.<br /><br />He seems to enjoy eating them and I know they are better than most of the stuff out there since they are made by a company with such high standards for food."}
