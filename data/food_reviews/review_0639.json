After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others."}
