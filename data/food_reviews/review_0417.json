When I found it on Amazon with a good price as a subscription, I was thrilled. Our daughter lives in Texas and is gluten intolerant so I mail her items on a regular basis. This has become a staple in her kitchen. Anything you can make with regular Bisquik you can adapt using this. So now she makes cookies, pancakes and biscuits to her heart's content. Taste and texture of items made with it are good."}
