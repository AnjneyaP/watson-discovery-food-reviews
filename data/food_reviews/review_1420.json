Boy was I wrong. I had to go out for a few hours so gave each pooch a treat (the treats are rather large) and left. Normally the treats are swallowed so quickly I often wonder if they even taste them. But not these treats. After being away over 2 hours I came back to find both treats still there, still whole. So while I would give this product a 5 just knowing everything about it is the best - my pups give it a 1, hence the average of 3.<br />Both my pups are Maltese - 5 and 7 pounds and they may just be overly picky, but they are all I have to go by."}
