ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable."}
