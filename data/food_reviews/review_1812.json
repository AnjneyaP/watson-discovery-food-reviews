Anyone on a diet or watching their fat intake, should give this a try!  I could not believe how delicious this is!  And why not?  It's all real peanuts!  Mix with water (probably a bit more than the package says) and you get a creamy, spreadable, delicious peanut butter!  You will not miss anything, except the calories!"}
