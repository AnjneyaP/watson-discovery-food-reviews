But in our house that is all. We have been GFree for 3 years and yes, I have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make A LOT of GF stuff for EVERYONE. We LOVE the Pamela's baking mix for pancakes/waffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend THE ULTIMATE BEST out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes. But I will buy this mix (and yes, I do agree it is AWFULLY EXPENSIVE) for those three things I've mentioned and in a GF household, usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste. Not one flour does the best with everything."}
