I like Kind Plus and tried several varieties.  They have almonds, not peanuts as other brands have and this makes a big difference.  They taste grate and very fulfilling.  Each bar still has 12 gram of sugar, so be careful and do not eat too many at once, but one a day as between meals snack is OK : )"}
