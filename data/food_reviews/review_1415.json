Not so with the Newman's Own Organic treats. Made of high-quality organic products, including lamb, barley, and apples, they're nice and solid without being rock hard, they smell like something good and wholesome, and both of my dogs absolutely love them. I like that they come in a resealable (and recyclable) plastic pouch, too. No more worries about accidentally bringing home beetle-infested biscuits as I've done on more than one occasion.<br /><br />I've enjoyed several of Newman's Own's product for people and would wholeheartedly recommend their dog treats to owners who care about their pets' health and happiness. Two enthusiastic paws up."}
