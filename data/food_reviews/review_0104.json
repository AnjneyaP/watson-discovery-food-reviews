Price is awful.","Text":"I really like the Mueslix cereal, but the Amazon price is awful.<br />$22.73 for a 5 pack is over $4.50 a box.<br />This product RETAILS in the stores here for around $4 a box (Publix, Kroger, Ingles).<br />So the Amazon price is higher than retail.<br /><br />Mueslix is almost never on sale though, unlike other Kellogg's cereals.<br />1-2 times per year, Publix grocery has all Kellogg's cereals for half price.<br />$2/box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks.<br /><br />I expected the Amazon price to be more like $3/box, since it was a 5 pack.<br />But boy was I wrong."}
