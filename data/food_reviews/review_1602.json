After exhaustive research and a few costly vet trips, we discovered that she is allergic to chicken....  I switched to Eukanuba lamb and rice and she did better, but still had occasional vomiting issues...  Then one day I saw an add for Blue online, and my world changed almost overnight...  She loves the taste, (including the little life-source bits) her coat is shinier, and my carpets are clean and odor free for the first time in a LONG LONG time.....<br /><br />Thanks Blue, we love you, so does Chanel"}
