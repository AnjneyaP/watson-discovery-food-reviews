It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless."}
