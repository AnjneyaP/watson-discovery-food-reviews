They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are \"meaty\" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"}
