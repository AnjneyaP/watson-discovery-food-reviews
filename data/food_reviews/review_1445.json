No sugar needed, just pour a cup of coffee and add 2 of these creamers and you are all set to go, most of my mornings now starts with this! The funny thing is that I wasn't a big coffee drinker to begin with, but now I love my cup of joe in the morning, all thanks to this little guy!<br /><br />If you like your coffee then wouldn't regret getting this and Amazon subscription service is great, gives you a great price and no hassle delivery!<br /><br />I had read reviews about the fact that packaging was poorly done and it would be a sticky mess when it gets to you! Fortunately mine wasn't no bursts or ruptures, they have either figured out a way to improve the packaging, or I got lucky!"}
