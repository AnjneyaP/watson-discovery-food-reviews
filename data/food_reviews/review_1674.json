The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying."}
