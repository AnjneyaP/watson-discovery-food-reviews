The more peanut butter there is in a sweet, the better it is. The 6 oz egg totally fulfilled his dream of eating pure peanut butter. The chocolate to peanut butter ratio is really small, so those people who enjoy peanut butter rather the combination of it with chocolate would be satisfied. People were saying about the prices, but a convenience of the package delivered to your front door is totally worth it, especially for busy people. Very satisfied and would buy again."}
