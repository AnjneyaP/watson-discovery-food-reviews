I bought this oil mainly for cooking stir fry dishes in high heat.  The oil appears to be thicker than grapeseed oil.  The only thing I am not sure about is if this avocado oil is cold pressed.  I sent an email to the manufacturer but did not receive a straight answer.  Their reply is that all their oils are pressed by expeller-presser at room temperature without using any chemicals.  I think I will try the other brands of avocado oil that are advertised \"organic and cold-pressed\" after I am done with this order."}
