I like the idea of the alkalinized pH and electrolytes...but I'm not willing to spend the amount asked for this product.  For pennies on the dollar I can mix an electrolyte formula at home, add some gatorade powder, or eat a salted banana or some prunes to restore electrolytes.  I also am certain that the pH will make no difference long term if one's diet is not also addressed (in which case this water is no longer needed).  There is a lot of information available online about the acidity of foods and the types of symptoms one can expect if they have trouble with pH...and what to do about it.  I'd rather spend my money on the right food than on expensive bottled water that is likely no better than what I already have under my kitchen sink.  I did like the 1.5L bottle, I liked the water...I just am not convinced it is worth the price or the convenience."}
