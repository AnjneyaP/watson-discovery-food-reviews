With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less \"tasty\" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product."}
