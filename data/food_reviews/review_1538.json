It's not sticky like gluten free rice pasta and doesn't have the weird taste of whole grain pasta. It's pretty much the same to me as regular pasta and I grew up on italian cooking. Now that I have digestive issues I eat gluten free and have to say this is my new favorite pasta! Thanks Amazon for your subscribe and save which makes it affordable as well. Eating healthy is expensive and it's great to have this option to make it more affordable!!"}
