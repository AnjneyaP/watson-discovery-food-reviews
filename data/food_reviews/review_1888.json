It was about time that I tried the brand! I cannot in good conscience say anything about the English Breakfast or Irish Breakfast, as I'm not a big fan of black tea, let alone STRONG black tea as these. But I made a lovely discovery: the Lady Grey. I wrote a review about it saying how it quickly became my favorite comfort tea. As for the Earl Grey, it's passable when I'm out of Lady Grey, but only if I steep it for a few short seconds - otherwise it's too strong.<br /><br />Whatever is the case, here you have the chance to try 4 flavors and find your favorite. Being a 6-pack, you won't have too much of any one tea, which is a good thing.<br /><br />And now I definitely want to try more Twinings flavors."}
