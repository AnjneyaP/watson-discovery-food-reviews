The China Mist brand is good, the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine, so there is sediment in the tea. I recommend letting the tea settle before serving. China Mist is not extremely high-quality, just a nice every-day tea that tastes fine. The sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety, and it lasts a while."}
