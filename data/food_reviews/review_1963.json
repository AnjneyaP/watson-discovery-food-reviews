There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.<br /><br />They go great with lunches or as a snack. They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags). I will be trying some of the other intriguing flavors. Recommended."}
