So when I found powdered peanut butter (with more than half the fat removed, but with the same peanutty taste), I was in heaven.<br /><br />Now I can mix it with my yogurt and/or ice cream; make my peanut butter pie and don't feel quite as guilty while totally enjoying the flavor.<br /><br />And ... so does my daughter-in-law who is a big fan of peanut butter also.<br /><br />So for all those peanut butter lovers out there, I highly recommend the Powdered Peanut Butter!!!"}
