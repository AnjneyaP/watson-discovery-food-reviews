Unlike many bottled waters or sports drinks, I did not find a metallic aftertaste and I did not detect an odor. I was a bit concerned with the price--though the Amazon price of almost 30 bucks for a 12 pack of 1.5 liter bottles seems a bit more reasonable than some of the other prices out there. Still, this is reservoir water--as other reviewers note. While the water was refreshing enough and kept me hydrated, if I'm going to pay this much for water, I would prefer something a bit more natural."}
