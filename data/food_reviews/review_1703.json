Not to mention the Folgers select are always a few bucks less then the other premium coffees. For some reason the selection at my local stores has dwindled and they don't have this blend. They only have the funky flavored blends. Don't know if this is from Folgers' end or Walmart's continuing limitation of product selection. Love this coffee, hope is stays around."}
