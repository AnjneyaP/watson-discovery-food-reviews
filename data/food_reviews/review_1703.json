This water is exceedingly smooth, no after-taste water that has no weird after taste. I shared this with my daughter after a cross country meet and she said she felt much more hydrated than with drinking \"regular\" water and less sugary than sports drinks.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the quality and taste of this water and recommend it."}
