What impressed me most was that there was an oxygen scavenger inside the tins thereby maintaining the freshness. Also, the manufacturer recommends storing the peanuts in a refrigerator which I think is a good recommendation especially since peanuts are prone to becoming rancid.<br />However, I would like to add that since these are lightly salted peanuts and if you are used to eating the regular salted peanuts, there is a marked difference in taste.<br />A beautiful package too. Recommended!"}
