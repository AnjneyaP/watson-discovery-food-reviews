The different types of coffee and how it brewed.<br />HOWEVER - I did not realize how expensive the coffee K-cups would be.  I couldn't spend 80.00 dollars a month on coffee!!<br /><br />Then I found DISPOSAKUPS - What a great idea and they are so easy to use. The very best part about them is that fact that they can be thrown away - No having to wash the insert that Keurig provides.<br /><br />These cups do not leak.  They work perfectly!  I will be ordering more."}
