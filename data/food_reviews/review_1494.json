I was happy to find this product under the brand of Bookbinder's, an old and well-respected Philly restaurant, and I bought a case.  Unfortunately, the soup doesn't taste anything like what it's supposed to.  It's bitter, and has an off-smell and -taste.  The few small bits of turtle are hard to find.  The soup itself had the consistency of paste, and didn't taste much better.  I ate this stuff just because I was taught not to waste food, but it was a struggle.  I guess I'll have to wait until I visit the city for some of the real stuff.  You should, too."}
