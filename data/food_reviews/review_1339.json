She forgot to mention how bitter and yucky tasting this stuff was for dogs. My girl wouldn't eat it mixed with can food, yogurt or cottage cheese. I found these pill pockets and thought why not give them a try. They work great. I poor the powder in the center and mold the treat around the yucky powder and my girl gobbles them down.<br /><br />Best idea ever. I highly recommend these for giving pills, powders or liquids (they are water proof for holding liquid med's also). If your dog/cat does not like the treats Greenies does refund your money.<br /><br />Nice product."}
