He loves these brownies. I make them with egg white and water instead of the oil to cut out the added fat, but they are still great and easy to make. The only drawback is that they are full of sugar, which makes my son hyper-stim so we have to dole them out one at a time.<br /><br />We buy them buy the case from Amazon every few months. Thanks Gluten Free Pantry."}
