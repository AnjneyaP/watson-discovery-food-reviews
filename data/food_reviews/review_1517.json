Larabar pecan pie has no gluten or dairy, and it actually tastes great!  The bars are 1.6 ounces, which I find just the right size for a snack.  The pecan flavor is sweet, but not too sweet, and the bar has a nice balance between soft and crunchy. There are 220 calories in each bar, and 130 of them are fat calories, but this is FAR healthier for you than any candy bar.  Ingredients are dates, pecans, and almonds- amazingly simple!<br /><br />Highly recommended."}
